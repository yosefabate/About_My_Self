            <td class="text">This is Noah. She just the best. I miss her, she learning pharma at the moment, hope all goes well for her. <br></br>I don't really like the drawing. 
                She forced me into drawing her, and I haven't had time to draw her properly, perfectly. 
                maybe I'll draw her properly some other day.</td>
