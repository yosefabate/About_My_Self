        <p class="text3">In the future i want to have a moore advanced education from qualified educating organizations. I want to build a modern and cultural buildings for my country.  I also want to build a city that is dedicated for production of entertainment. I want to design the building of hope entertainment which will look like the letter H when looked from above. I also want the transportation system like cars and trains to all be underground so we can use the open fields that are occupied by them ow on producing green areas, where people can spend their leisure time.
          <br></br>  I also want to participate in charity organizations. There are many homeless peoples in ethipia who lives in streets so as an architect I want to put my share to overcome this problem by designing buildings that can be built with low cost for these peoples.
